# Listen Task

Listen Task is like a breakpoint of the code. Workflow Runtime stops at the Listen Task and listens for the external event to resumed. Events can be like HTTP/Kafka/Socket. (Currently only HTTP Support. In future will implement Kafka and other Wrappers)

```json title="Listen Task Example"
