## High Level Flow

1. User calls `/start` api with `definition_id`.
2. Transport Controller creates a runtime in database for logs and result persistance.
3. Transport Controller calls Engine to process Start Task.
4. Engine processes the incoming task with the help of different processor based on Task Type.
5. Engine saves the logs, result and status of Workflow runtime in the database.
6. Engine calls Transport Service to process next task.
7. Transport service calls kafka topic/http api based on config set.
